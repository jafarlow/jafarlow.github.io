        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I am a software developer with a background in IT resource management. I've been looking for an opportunity to switch from hardware to software for a while and have been crafting skills on front-end web development. I've held a variety of positions over the years, all of which have shaped me into someone who is perpetually curious and always seeking to learn and grow.</p>
